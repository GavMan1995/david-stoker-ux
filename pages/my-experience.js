              A degree in advertising and work as an art director
            </h3>
            <p>
              From college to ad agencies, I learned to begin every project by
              first understanding the customer, the user â€“ then figuring out
              ways to connect with them. And powerful, meaningful connections
              often come from paring down all a company wants to say.

            <p>
              My recent work at Pluralsight had me creating concepts for their
              social channels. I developed offbeat, fun ideas that spoke to the
              personalities and culture of their core users increasing
              engagement and response across all channels.
